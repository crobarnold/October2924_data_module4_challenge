PyCity Schools average math score is 79% with an average of 75% of the student polluction passing math with a grade of 70% or higher. The average reading score is 82% with an average of 86% of the student population passing reading with a grade of 70% or higher. 65% of the PyCity Schools student population pass both math and reading with grades of 70% or higher. Data shows that distict schools has the greater population of students and funding. PyCity charter schools has a smaller population of students and funding and have higher math and reading average scores and have more student passing both math and reading with a grade of 70% or higher.

# Thought - Conclusion 1 - Smaller, well-funded schools (like charters) might be able to provide more focused or specialized academic attention, leading to better student outcomes.

# Thought - Conclusion 2 - This data suggests a potential need for analyzing how resources are allocated and distributed between district and charter schools to improve the overall performance of the entire district.
